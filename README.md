# This is the instruction of how to use this Google Drive

## Step 1: Download your design file
Make sure you are in "Kitchen & Bath" mode in Design Studio first (Advanced Tools --> Kitchen & Bath). 

Go to File --> Export JSON --> Kitchen & Bath --> Generate --> Download.

## Step 2: Drag your JSON file into your Google folder
Before you drag the JSON file you just downloaded into the Google folder, it might not be a bad idea to change the name of the file. I recommend <span style="color: #66FFFF;">myAwesomeDesign.json</span>.

## Step 3: Check your result
After you drag your file into the Google folder, the result html file should appear in less than 30 seconds. It should have the same name as your design file. For instance, if you drag in <span style="color: #66FFFF;">myAwesomeDesign.json</span>, it should output <span style="color: #66FFFF;">myAwesomeDesign.html</span>.

To check the html file, double click on it and select "Open with Google Chrome" option on top.

## Step 4: Revise your design
You're telling me my design file is not perfect? Excuse me? 

More than likely you will need to go back and revise your design file to match the test file. This script first checks if you have missing and/or extra items. And after everything is correctly added, it will check if any of the parameters are not configured correctly. For instace, the width, height, and depth of a closet, rotation, material, led config, panel config, etc.

You might get a lot of errors at first. Don't smash your laptop just yet! It could just be that you placed one cabinet slighly off in the y-direction by 2 inches, resulting in all the other cabinets be off by 2 inches as well. Please be patient when checking the error log. 

## Step 5: Complain to the software engineer that did this
A lot of testings are needed to improve the usability of this script. If you encounter any difficulties, please let me know. All feeback is welcomed! I appreciate your help!
